# fluxblock
Bitcoin has a big problem. Bitcoin mining consumes a huge amount of electricity and canâ€™t be sustainable.  As of 9/4/2018, every bitcoin transaction consumes around 900 kwh of electricity and total bitcoin electricity consumption is close to the country of Austria. Unfortunately, this problem is largely ignored. FLUX Block is created for providing a framework of decentralized energy infrastructure powering future blockchain applications.  

## Scope of FLUX Block project
Blockchain is technically a distributed system, however, in addition to a great amount of energy consumption, the mining tends to be centralized. FLUX Block is building a genuine distributed blockchain network backboned by distributed renewable energy to provide the distributed energy infrastructure to support sustainable blockchain applications. The FLUX Block provides a framework to enable the transformation from renewable energy to distribute ledgers where renewable energy is collected, measured, converted to electricity and recorded by a proposed FLUX smart meter, and the electricity is then used for distributed mining.
